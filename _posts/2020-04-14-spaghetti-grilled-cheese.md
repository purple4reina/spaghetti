    1. Boil water and cook spaghetti as directed.
    2. Slice 2 pieces of cheese or enough to cover each side of the bread.
    3. In a skillet, melt butter then place in the 2 slices of bread.  Add one
       slice of cheese on each side.  Cook on low to medium heat until cheese
       begins to melt.
    4. When pasta is done, drain it and return it to the pot.  Add enough
       marinara sauce to completely coat the pasta.
    5. Place pasta carefully in middle of the two slices of bread, making a
       sandwich.  Continue heating until bread has browned and cheese is
       completely melted.

I love grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup.  This little twist brings all
the cheesy gooey goodness of the sandwich with the pasta-y goodness of the
spaghetti.  This is definitely one of my favorite spaghetti recipes!
