I enjoyed both making and eating this spaghetti pancake! There wasn't much
weird about the taste or texture. It was just a very dense pancake. I prefer
the light and fluffy pancakes, so though this wasn't at all a bad recipe, I
don't think I will make it again. But, if you enjoy a good dense and hearty
pancake, you'll probably love this!

Be sure to flip it when it is golden brown. I have a tendency to burn things,
but this one turned out just right!
